<b><font size="2">Introduction.</font></b><font size="2">The role of sport and sport education
in Europe is assuming a greater degree of significance in today's society. The need for
purposeful and healthy forms of leisure and recreation is very evident within the European
Union. In addition, the role of sport in promoting the social, economic and cultural goals
of the Union is now a matter of considerable debate and without doubt, sport is an area
with much latent and untapped potential.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Exercise and fitness, as part of sport, is growing
strongly. The importance of sport in general and exercise and fitness more specific, will
be made clear. Besides it is shown in what way exercise and fitness contributes in a
qualitative way to the promotion of people on the move.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Societal importance of sport In 1992 a draft charter
European Sport was discussed by the European ministers responsible for sport. In this
paper it was stated: </font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- &quot;Sport is a social and cultural activity which
plays a fundamental role in the strengthening of the relationships between citizens in
Europe and the development of an awakening of consciousness of an European
identity.&quot;; </font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- &quot;Measures will be taken to assure that all
citizens have the opportunity to participate in sport.&quot;;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- &quot;Playing games with the purpose to recreate,
benefit health or improve performances, will be encouraged at all levels of society by
making facilities, programmes and qualified leaders available&quot;;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- &quot;All necessary initiatives will be taken to
develop physical fitness and basic abilities and to encourage young people to participate
in sport.&quot;;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- &quot; Sport is an integral part of the social
cultural development.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">These statements show the social and cultural importance
of sport in all its manifestations. In addition we would like to add the following
strengths which sport brings to the European context:</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- Sport offers many possibilities to achieve societal
goals such as mental and physical health, civic virtues, tolerance, emancipation,
integration of minorities and respect for fellow-citizens. _</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In fact sports offers itself as a new bond for society.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- Active and passive participation in sport has risen
enormously in the last 25 years when we look at: the number of participants, volunteers,
high level sports persons and the exposure in/through the media.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- The importance of sport as an area of economic
activity has increased looking at the money spent by consumers, authorities and companies.
The interest of the media in sport and the recognition by sponsors of sport as a
commercial opportunity has increased.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- The positive effects of sport for the participant:
pleasure and satisfaction; improvements in health; supports the development of personal
standards and values.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- The positive effects of sport for society as a whole:
because of the number of participants sport has become one of the most important
democratizing phenomena in society; it is a perfect tool for the integration of societal
groups; sport has become a place for social and societal experiences.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">At an European level sport may help to strengthen social
cohesion and mutual understanding.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Professionalization Coaches, exercise and fitness
professionals, physical education teachers and</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">other leaders in sport must be highly qualified for
their task. The work of those profesionals is more and more influenced by the following
developments:</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- Sport performances at al levels are increasing. For
this reason higher demands are put on those who help/support people to participate in
sport.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- There is a great variety in the motives of people to
participate in sport and the nature of it. This implies a need for more specialists.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- Professionalization of sport is taking place at all
levels in such a way that the work and the organization is more and more structured.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">- National developments are more and more dependent on
those at an international level and consequently the issues of professionalization and
standards which span international boundaries have become more and more important.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">One of the main problems in sport is the lack of
organized social partners in most of the European countries. Because of this the role of
training institutions in sport is over-exposed. There is a strong need for a constructive
co-operation between representatives of the field of sport and training institutions,
acknowledging both specific responsabilities for the professionalization process.</font></p>
<b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Qualification Structure for the Training of Exercise and
Fitness Professionals</font></p>
</b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The European Network Fitness Committee, which is part of
the European Network of Sport Sciences in Higher Education, has developed a qualifiaction
structure for the training of exercise and fitness professionals. In fact the
qualification structure describes, in recognizable but general terms, the work and
training of professionals at five different levels; it is a guideline for the development
of new programmes for (vocational) training but may also be used to consider existing
programmes.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Besides initiatives have been taken to develop a
programme for 'learning in the workplace' and 'lifelong learning'.</font></p>
<b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Quality standard</font></p>
</b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">By means of a quality standard, which defines the lower
limits of the quality offered by fitness facilities, it is possible to increase the image
of the sector. In this way consumers may be kindled with enthousiasm to participate in an
exercise and fitness programme. Besides, once the standard is set it is possible to
increase the standard in a structured way.</font></p>
<b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">People on the move</font></p>
</b>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Because ot the arguments given in the paragraphs 1 and 2
it is important that more and more people become active in sport. In fact it is the
responsability of the government. The sector of sport, physical edudation and exercise and
fitness have to take their responsability for a client oriented offer. Only then it is
possible to get people on the move. It is shown in the paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 how the
sector of exercise and fitness deals with her reponsability. Through international
co-operation all parties may profit from each other and need not invent the wheel for the
second time. People on the move, let's do it!</font></p>
