    size="2">Materials of this book are devoted to the complex direction in sciences about a
    man - integrative biosocial anthroplogy. Being secondly born on the verge of the XXI-th
    century (the anthropology if the XIX-th and the beginning of the XX-th centuries had been
    integrative one originally), it is appealed to improve the potential of human activities'
    various kinds in training-educational and social-pedagogical areas. The
    separatly-objective knowledges about a human being are alloyed jointly, giving the notion
    about somatopsychical, personality-sociocultural and organizm-environmental integrity. In
    this way, that science carries out the most important function to garmonize the knowledges
    about a human being. Attracting attention to the weakly studied problems, it makes their
    solving topical for general level of knowledges widening. Due to the influence of the
    integrative anthropology's ideas and principles, the interdisciplinary investigations
    become significant on the traditional sciences' junctions: anatomy and physiology,
    psychology and physiology, biology and sociology etc. The predominant both in classical
    and contemporary integrative anthropology the paradigm of the individual and personality
    mutability's forms and factors serves like the catalyst and the directing core of these
    scientific searches. Does the commanding idea of various knowledges' about human being
    harmonization realize itself in the deeping consideration of the linked and unlinked
    mutability's forms.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Among many of theoretical
    constructions in the contemporary integrative biosocial anthropology we had attracted a
    reader's attention to the most fundamental aspects connected with a practice's demands:
    psychological, constitutional and ecological ones. The question is - why?</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Imagine this scientific
    area as a mountain ridge, imagine also the mountain-climber who tries to climber up that
    ridge searching the knowledges. In that case the top of the mountain can be reached most
    difficultly, but just for this reason is the most attractive - that is the <b>psychological
    anthropology.</b> The mountain slope which is tried to be overpowered by the mountain
    climber from science, removing from one nature-climatical zone to another - that is the<b>
    ecological anthropology</b>. The Nature's project, that was realized after this mountain
    massifs had appeared and the laws directed by its creation at the epoches highly distant
    from us - that is the <strong>constitutional anthropology</strong>.</font><b></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Otherwise, the
    constitutional anthropology answers the question: why are we such ones, as we are. The
    ecological anthropology explains - how had we become such ones. And psychological
    anthropology teaches - why we realize our particularity, singling ourselves out of anyone
    similar to us. But at the same time everyone of these aspects in integrative biosocial
    anthropology demonstrates the individual originality of our beingness and factors
    determining it.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The given book had
    completed the trilogy dedicated to the problem of a human being from the positions of the
    integrative anthropology. The first part of the trilogy (Essays of integrative
    anthropology's theory and practive), giving the general characteristics of this
    respectively new for a reader ares of knowledges, had underlined the reality of its
    historical roots. Their solidness and initiality are in eternal humanity's notions about
    the unity of the corporal, spiritual and mental substances in man. These notions are
    confirmed by the traditions of the Christian theology but in their essence they are of the
    common mentality. The community of human .microcosm, the conditionality of its
    distribution into the parts, their close contigency, the inseparable connectivity of the
    last ones with each other are sensed in conjunction with the views on the unity of a human
    being and the material and spiritual universe surrounding him (her). Therefore we have a
    right to say after the English philosopher and poet John Dann, that a Human Being is not
    an island but a part of a continent.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The historical roots of the
    intergrative anthropology are different over the depth of their occurrence. They are in
    the traditionalistic outlooks of Christian spirituality's Fathers. They are in the
    concepts of the post naturalists about a man's dependence on the general lows of Nature
    and in the ideas of the leading domestic schools' psychologists - B.M. Teplov, V.S.
    Merlin,<b> B.G.</b> Ananyev,<b> A.B.</b> Petrovsky, V.V. Davydov and others - about the
    inseparable wholeness of Human Being as the psychobiological phenomenon in spite of its
    components' ruggedness in separate cooperating systems of properties and qualities
    (hierarchic levels).</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The idea about the
    integrative contingency of the sciences about Human Being is not the original one. But the
    new in its putting is the problem; what functions of them can be adopted by integrative
    anthropology without making damage to the scientific realities, when conserving the
    composed and traditionally existing sciences about Human Being? What are the general
    principles of the integrative anthropology's reconstruction and what does determine the
    demands in it?</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The task of two last issues
    of trilogy (&quot;Integrative pedagogical anthropology&quot; and &quot;Integrative
    biosocial anthropology&quot;) was reduced to the foundation (by the examples of some
    concrete areas in pedagogical and ecological knowledge) the oportunity to increase the
    effectiveness of some human practice's kinds, to optimize the conditions of a man's
    functioning in the complicated situations of natural an social environment, to elaborate
    the well-founded means of the scientific prediction in the interests of biology,
    psychology, sociology and policy.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The human life's saturation
    by new phenomena and events advances the problems of the qualitive and quantitive orders.
    The solving of the first ones has often the intensive character: faster, stronger, more
    energetic etc. But this way of the human factor's improvement is practically passed up to
    the end. The XX-th century had exhausted almost completely the opportunities of the
    activities' optimization through its intensity's increasing. It becomes necessary to
    search the new extensive forms to improve the human factor by transfering onto the new
    quantative level by means of the new less expensive technologies' introduction and the
    labour potential's saving. Coming into the XXI-th century we must investigate the
    untraditional ways of the human practices' optimization. The authors of this book discern
    them in the realization of the integrative anthropology's ideas and elaborations about
    somatopsychical, personality-sociocultural and organism-environmental kind of unity,
    considered from the positions of the doctrine about the living systems.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">&quot;If they light the
    stars, somebody needs it&quot;, - said the Poet. Araising mentally over the peaks of the
    integrative anthropology we are not only understand through what difficulties we had
    passed, but also why the sky shines above us.</font></td>
