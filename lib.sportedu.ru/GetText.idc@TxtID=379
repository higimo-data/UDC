&quot;HANDBALL.VER.4.1.&quot;</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">M.Shestakov, I.Shestakov, V.Zoobkov</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Russian State Academy of Physical Education,<sup> </sup>Handball
Club &quot;Kunzevo&quot;, <br>
Moscow, Russia</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The program &quot;HANDBALL.VER.4.1.&quot;. is based on the theory of
technical and tactical training of sportsmen which in its turn leans upon such fundamental
sciences as: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, biomechanics.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The program includes (embraces) an unique base of tactical exercises
(more than 3000). But it is not a simple list of exercises. All the exercises are
classified according to the tasks solved by them. Such classification permits to choose
quickly among all the exercises just that one which is necessary at this or that stage of
training, for this or that purpose. It is very convenient but a single exercise is not
sufficient for training. Our program also permits to create (or to use already created)
complexes of exercises for a training session of this or that trend of training. And how
to know if the chosen exercise can be used in the chosen complex? The answer on this
question you will find in the section &quot;Statistics&quot; of our program. </font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In the same section you can find also everything that concerns the team
and the players. This block contains data about each training session of your team, you
will see what were the roles of the players, who fulfilled the tasks of forward, back or
goalkeeper, who was absent. All this information is regularly put into the program by the
coach and is presented as a certain data base, that makes it possible for him to find
quickly the necessary item and to work with it at any moment. For a coach it is important
to possess the information not only about recent training sessions, but also about
training cycles of various duration. Our program gives the possibility by pressing a
certain key to get the summarized data of all training sessions of the last week, month or
even of the whole year-long cycle.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Another advantage of our program consists in the possibility to compare
all the players of the team, what makes it easier to decide who of them should play in
this or that game, against this or that rival. It shows clearly who of the players is able
to fulfill better this or that tactical task.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">With the help of our program you can model various schemes of attaque
and defence actions to be used later in the game. It is the computer who will help you to
compose the appropriate complex of exercises. It is very convenient. For example if you
have known the peculiarities of your rival only one day before the match, you will have no
time to invent the complex of exercises corresponding to the tactical scheme that should
be used in the game. Practice shows that as a rule that or similar complex of exercises
has been trained before and with the help of our program you can easily find the necessary
tactical scheme and look through the exercises corresponding to it. The chosen complex of
exercises should be used during the morning training session to make the players recollect
the tactical scheme. </font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The program is &quot;clever&quot; enough to operate such quantitive
indices of training as the amount and the intensity of an exercise. As the result one can
examine the training process according to the zones of intensity. All these parameters can
be found in the section &quot;Statistics&quot;.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Practice has shown that the most coaches are satisfied with the work of
this program. Only one inconvenience was revealed. There exists an innumerable number of
exercises and each coach would like to have his favourite exercises in the data base. As
in a handball club such a program is usually used by several coaches, we have decided to
adapt it to the training process of a concrete club (team) and to link the training
process of all the club teams of different age. For this reason before the installation of
our program the main strategic line should be discussed and elaborated - from beginners to
masters. In this case the program can model the whole process of the long-term training of
handball players and it can be used both for children and experienced athletes. We think
that it is a good way to solve the problems mentioned at the beginning of the article. </font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Please remember that we continue to work at the program. It is
constantly perfected. We try to consider the wishes of all the coaches who use it. We
ensure the program maintenance and organise courses of the theory of technical training in
sports. We hope to achieve success in such union of theory and practice.</font></p>
