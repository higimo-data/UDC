    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">It is anaerobic capacity which determines the level of
    performance in the events of speed character. Sprint running can be certainly counted
    among them. Thus, during the conductance of sports training, it is crucial to monitor
    athletes' capacity regularly. To accomplish it successfully one must select a set of
    criteria which would characterise this kind of effort in the best possible way.
    Contemporary researches have shown [Brooks G., Fahey T. 1985,Hollmann w., Hettinger T.
    1980, Rovland 1996] that the most important role is played by the determiners of one's
    energetic potential. Under the conditions of exercise of high intensity [when there is an
    O2 shortage], it is anaerobic capacity which determines the efficiency of work [Keul J. et
    al. 1978, Platonov V. 1997]. In order to determine the level of one's capabilities of
    adaptation, the energetic transformations occuring during anaerobic work, should be
    estimated on the basis of three cryteria: effectiveness criterion, power criterion and the
    capacity criterion.[MacDougall J.D. et al. 1991, Volkov N. 1987] On the basis of solid
    research presented in many reports and own observations conducted during training sessions
    of athletes specializing in the sprint events, a system of laboratorial cycloergometric
    tests was worked out. The next stage of the investigation consisted of checking
    effectiveness of application of this form of training control. On the grounds of the
    results achieved, the complex sets of the most effective training solutions were built.
    Their construction was based predominantly on the characteristics of energetic
    transformations and the possibility for the smooth cooperation of metabolic effects of
    chemical processes. By doing this, the range of work which did not effect directly
    adaptation processes was minimised. These steps, aimed at the reduction of unnecessary
    work, were taken on the assumption that at the present stage of knowledge on sports
    training, the rationalization of applied training madia is of vital importance.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><strong><font size="2">Material and methods</font></strong></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The characteristics of the subjected groups is presented
    in Table 1. Tests were carried out according to the periodization of a year's training
    cycle, four times in the years 1995 and 1996. P.H's training work out in the period prior
    to the participation in the Olympic Games was assigned on the basis of the results
    achieved in the control tests. The subjects performed the test on a cycle ergometer Monark
    824E within the period of three days.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The following parameters were registred by means of the
    computer programme MCE: peak anaerobic power, total work, maximal anaerobic power, average
    maximal power, the coefficient of power decrease, average power, average relative power,
    time of achieving, time of maintaing. During the conductance of the tests the
    concentration of lactate [Hla] was determined by means of Dr Lang's photometer LP-400 and
    reagents LKM-140 [Dr Lange - Germany]. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Statistical methods were reduced consideraby assuming
    that in the case of small groups of insignificant differentiation /resulting from the
    specifity of specialization/ applying them in a full degree would not display a clear
    picture of alterations being caused by training media.[Gabryњ T. et al. 1996, Platonov.
    V. 1997, Volkov N. 1987] Therefore, only means and standard variations were calculated.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><strong><font size="2">Results</font></strong></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Maximal power in the process of anaerobic and
    non-lactate fueling is obtained already after 0.5-0.7 sec. post the beginning of exercise
    and can be maintained for 7 to 10 seconds. In the conducted investigation, estimation of
    this area of adaptation processes was based on the test of 10-second duration. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Analysis of the data obtained during the 10-sec. test of
    phosphogenic power enabled to determine specific post-exercise effects achived as a result
    of applied training solutions. The runner - P.H. obtained the top of anaerobic capacity
    planed for the year 1996 already after the first preparatory period. The 400m
    specialization required from him mainly the development of glycolyctic fraction during the
    second preparatory period. The volume, intensity and sort of the training media properly
    determined, enabled to maintain the obtained level of phosphagenic power in the course of
    furher periods. The applied testing procedure confirmed the correctness of the assumed
    direction of instruction. In the groups of 16-17 and 18-19 year-old sprinters, there was
    primarily found an increase in the level of phosphogenic power after the first preparatory
    period, eventually followed by a decrease in the second part of year's training cycle. The
    revelation of such a tendency of anaerobic capacity alterations enabled to apply a
    correction of training plans aiming at the renovation and restorage of this essential
    source of energy supply in sprint-running.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">A significant role in sprint-running specialization
    /both during training sessions and competition/ is played by work of maximal intensity of
    up to 30 seconds of duration. Thus, this short bout of effort is related to re-syntesis of
    muscle ATP by paths of glycolysis [Brooks G., Fahey T. 1985]. It is believed that lactate
    concentration in the blood reflects the intensity of work as well as its character.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Analysis of glycolytic fraction of anaerobic capacity,
    carried out on the basis of the Wingate test, showed the strict relationship between the
    alterations of this parameter and the sort of training and specialization. The process of
    training in the groups of 100-200 meter sprinters was during the first preparatory period
    based on exercises developing phosphogenic power without paying attention to the
    amelioration of the system of energy supply through the pathways of anaerobic glycolysis.
    The applied correction of training plans, conducted after the end of the first preparatory
    period and indoor competition enabled the significant growth of this system, constituting
    a foundation for the augmentation of volume and intensity of media developing phosphogenic
    power which is a crucial element of sprinter's anaerobic capacity. [Bar-Or O. 1987,
    Gabryњ T. et al. 1996, Maud P., Schulz B. 1989, Tharp G. et al. 1984] The 400 runner
    developed the efficiency of the system of energy relase based on anaerobic glycolysis in
    conformity with the presumptions of the training plan during the first preparatory period.
    Thus, it was possible to apply training media which would maintain the obtained level
    during the second preparatory period. The further development of anaerobic capacity
    resulted from the broad applications of media aiming at the improvement of other areas of
    runner's preparation.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The prolongation of exercise duration with high
    intensity over 30 seconds is a difficult task for an athlete. However, it is attainable if
    an athlete is well-prepared. If efforts of up to 30 seconds are accompanied by glycolysis
    maximization, so to extend the time of intensive work maintenance, one needs to build
    specific propensities which are termed glycolyctic capacity. [Bar-Or O. 1987, Inbar O.
    1985, Inbar O. et al. 1996, Volkov N. 1987].</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The aplication of the 60-second test, specific for
    glycolitic power, enabled to obtain a complete view on the area of anaerobic capacity in
    the subjected sprinters. During P.H's preparation for the Olympic Games in Atlanta the
    training media were selected and applied on the basis of the obtained data. A lower than
    expected increase in the efficiency of energy supply for 60-second work, observed after
    the first preparatory period, gave a clue to the reduction of training media developing
    the glycolyctic power of medium duration /assessed by the Wingat Test/. Instead, there was
    applied a wider variety of training media adopting the athlete's organism into prolonged
    work under the conditions of an increacing oxygen deficit. The efficacy of the assumed
    conception of training control, was confirmed by P.H's sports results nd his high
    disposition throughout the whole scan of competition. The other sprinters also achieved
    the planed results and early enough applied corrections, disscused in this study,
    contributed to the racionalization of training process.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Conclusions</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The structure of the applied training media in the
    subjected groups of athletes was estimated on the basis of the range of adaptation
    processes to efforts occuring in the sprint events. On the grounds of the obtained
    results, the principles of the construction of a training unit were worked out.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The best results in the development of maximal anaerobic
    non-lactat power were achieved under the following conditions: maximal intensity of
    exercise, exercise time of up to 6 seconds, intervals of 90-120 seconds, individual
    exercise repeated no more than 4 times.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The best training effects in the development of glycolic
    fractions were obtained under the following conditions: maximal or close to maximal
    intensity of exercise, exercise time from 30 to 120 seconds dependingly of specialization
    and sports level, recovery interval between exercise repetitions corresponded to the
    number of repetitions according to the following scheme: between the 1-st and 2-nd
    repetition: 4-6 min., between the 2-nd and 3-rd repetition: 3-4 min., between the 3-rd and
    4-th repetition: 2 min., the number of repetitions not greater than 4.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In the two presented training programmes, one can also
    apply work in series with 3-4 repetitions and recovery varying from 12 to 30 minutes.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Chosing cycloergometric tests for estimation of
    adaptation processes occuring in the sprint events was entiraly useful regardless of the
    age and sports level. Constructing P.H's training programme on the basis of the results
    obtained in the process of cycloergometric tests enabled him to achieve outstanding
    results during the Olympic Games in Atlanta and World Junior Championships in Sydney. As
    the influence of the test results on the training programmes in the other two groups of
    subjects was small, the obtained results could not have been caunted as being condusive to
    the optimalization of training process.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Those subjects did not reveal their whole potential
    during competition. One of the reasons of the inefficiency of instruction was the fact
    that the selection of training media was based only on the basis of specific running tests
    which did not shed the full light on the level of adaptation to efforts.</font></p>
