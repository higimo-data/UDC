    <td><b><p align="center"><font size="2">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING DIFFERENT KIND OF
    ADAPTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS </font><i></p>
    <p ALIGN="RIGHT"><font size="2">Herman Van Coppenolle, Yves Vanlandewijck, <br>
    Peter Van de Vliet, &amp; Johan Simons <br>
    Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, <br>
    Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium</font></p>
    </i></b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In 1989 the
    European Association for Adapted Physical Activity was founded and this group of
    enthousiastic persons from different European universities started to collaborate very
    intensively around this very important topic : how to improve the situation of persons
    with a handicap by Adapted Physical Activity?</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The first question we
    tackled was:</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">how can we improve the
    training of university students in this field ?</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Therefore we started up
    the European Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Adapted Physical Activity in 1991 as an
    interuniverity cooperation program (28 universities) which runs already for 9 years now in
    Leuven, my university in Belgium , and in which already 150 students enrolled. But I
    talked already last year about this topic and will now concentrate on some general
    questions and answers. It is obvious that many of theses answers were provided by research
    data gathered through the master&amp;rsquo;s theses of this European Master&amp;rsquo;s
    Degree in Adapted Physical Activity, as well as through our longlife activity in this
    field.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Answers on questions</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">When should I start the
    &amp;ldquo;approach&amp;rdquo; for motivating persons with a handicap to participate?</b> </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The answer is &amp;ldquo;as
    soon as possible in the revalidation process&amp;rdquo;.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Which kind of information
    should be provided ? Why should I participate in sports activities? Where can I find the
    information about the sportsopportunities for several persons with a handicap ? In which
    sportactivity can I participate and where?</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Therefore we developed an
    information brochure for Flanders (the Flemish part of Belgium) providing all this
    information by attractive photographs about Omnisports (badminton, billiard, bowling,
    fitness, dance, darts, golf, hockey, ice-skating, outdoor activities, horse riding,
    gymnastics, fishing, folksports, self-defence), watersports (kayak, surfing, water-ski,
    sailing), Paralympic Disciplines (Summergames) (athletics, basketball, boccia, shooting
    (arrows), weightlifting), Paralympic Disciplines (Wintergames) (skiing, cross- country
    sit-skiing, goalball, judo, fencing, shooting, tabletennis, wheelchairtennis, soccer,
    volleyball, cycling, swimming).</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The motivation can also be
    enhanced by films for example by &amp;ldquo;I am not Disabled&amp;rdquo; (Film produced by
    Yves Vanlandewijck and Ives Jossa, K.U.Leuven) (Peace Medal Award of the United Nations)
    in which 4 persons with a handicap explain how sportsparticipation improved dramatically
    the quality of their lives.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">How should I run an
    adapted physical activity program once the person is motivated to participate?</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">First we need a global
    diagnosis of the physical and psychological possibilities and objectives. This means a
    careful examination of : </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">1. the physical capacities </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">2. the specific technical
    capacities </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">3. the psychological and
    social aspects for doing sports.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Also is needed counselling
    and coaching for competitive or recreative physical activities in order to avoid drop out
    and to assure a continuous success experience because participation in sports must always
    provide joy and a feeling of self-fulfilment and selfrealisation.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">For which groups of
    persons with a disability adapted physical activity programs can be beneficial?</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">For each person with a
    specific disability there are scientifically proven physical and psychosocial benefits.
    For persons with an intellectual disability I refer to the doctoral thesis of Jurate
    Mikelkйviciutй of Lithuania who develops a new observation method for determining the
    main objectives of an individualised adapted physical activity program of which the
    objective is the improvement of the quality of life for this specific person. With this
    new method we will be able to evaluate the results of a systematic program on these
    specific objectives. For autistic children there are specific strategies for the several
    types of autism: the classic autism, the Aperger&amp;rsquo;s syndrome and the Rett
    syndrome. Also for children with specific learning disabilities such as attention deficit
    disorders, language and writing problems, inability to receive information, problems in
    processing information and deficits in physical and motor abilities, there exist specific
    programs. The same for persons with emotional and psychiatric disturbances.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">There is a specialisation
    program of psychomotor therapy specialisation in Leuven (Belgium) for depressed patients,
    for anorexia nervosa patients and for schizophrenic persons. There are as well specific
    psychomotor diagnostic tools and programs for persons with neurological and orthopedical
    disabling conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,
    spinal cord injuries (wheelchairsports) and amputations.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The same approach exists
    for persons wit hearing impairments, for persons with visual impairments, for persons with
    physiological impairments such as respiratory problems (asthma, cystic fibrosis), internal
    problems (diabetes), cardiac problems (myocardinfarctus, hearttransplant), obesity, cancer
    and aids.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Which should be the
    training of the students in physical education or physiotherapy in order to become
    specialists in this field?</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">There is firstly the
    European Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Leuven which is a European training program with 27
    universities.in which also your students can participate. But we should develop other
    trainingprograms also on a lower level in order to have as many as possible experts in
    this field. You will be involved in an European Network &amp;ldquo;Education and Social
    integration of Persons with a Handicap through Adapted Physical Activity&amp;rdquo;, which
    will realise the co-ordination between the training programs in the universities, the
    ministries of education and health and the sportfederations for persons with a handicap in
    35 European countries (with inclusion of Russia).</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">How to be informed about
    what is going on in the world of Adapted Physical Activity?</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">You know through Prof.
    Dimitriev and Dr. Ozolina , the European leaders and you (through these same colleagues )
    participated on world conferences in Oslo (four years ago) and Barcelona (three
    month&amp;rsquo;s ago). So you know as well the world leaders in APA. You are member of
    the International Federation of Adapted Physical Activity and you receive the
    International Journal APAQ.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In conclusion</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Through this intensive
    co-operation in the international open world , you know better than before about all the
    positive aspects of APA. You are able to set up the best training programs for your
    students. You are linked with Europe and the World. You will be the APA leaders in Russia.
    but you should be better supported by your ministries and in better co-operation with the
    sports federations for persons with a handicap. I can conclude with the theme of this
    conference &amp;ldquo; Adapted Physical Activity and the Opened world&amp;rdquo;. Being
    involved in these international activities and organisations you solved already the
    problems of information, training scientific background and international inclusion and in
    this way you have the best possible perspectives to succeed in order to improve the
    quality of the Russian persons with a disability.</font></td>
