    working hypothesis has been suggested that transcutaneous electromyostimulation of lower
    leg improves the most important vegetative, i.e. haemodynamic and motoric functions
    exerting influence on industrial fatigue. With this aim in view over 200 women workers at
    different factories of Lithuania engaged in the sitting type of work at assembly-line have
    been examined directly at their working place. The results of the investigation have
    proved the validity of the working hypothesis about a positive influence of
    electromyostimulation in restoring the vegetative functions mentioned above. This also
    contributed to lessening of industrial fatigue in workers.</font></p>

    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">1. Introduction.</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The progress of
    technology is connected with negative influence of industrial hypokinesis on the skeletal
    muscular nervous system of the worker. It is especially evident in the type of the
    assembly-line work which is bound up with the sitting posture of the worker. The
    prevailing isometric character of muscular activity especially wears out the neck,
    shoulder girdle, back and leg muscles. Due to the disorder in the functioning of the
    muscle venous pump the peripheral circulation in the leg muscles, especially in the muscle
    triceps surae, is deranged. Here accumulates up to 31.5 per cent of venous blood which
    contributes to the rise of industrial fatigue and decrease of the working capacity.
    Electrical stimulation of skeletal muscles improves their trophicity and diminishes
    tiredness [ 1, 2, 3] . However, the problem has sill been insufficiently studied. All of
    the previous methods employed suffer at least from the following two drawbacks: first, the
    worker is being withdrawn from the working process and second, rehabilitation is being
    performed after the working shift.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">A method proposed by us is
    free of the drawbacks mentioned earlier. The main advantage of the method is that fatigue
    is diminished at workplace during the working process by elimination of predisposing
    factors at the very beginning of their action.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">As far as we know, the
    method of electrical stimulation suggested by us remains a pioneer of the kind.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">2. Methods.</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">I the period of several
    years, in a number of factors in Lithuania wide electroplethysmographic,
    electromyographic, ergometric research has been undertaken. Over 200 women workers aged
    35-55 years with work record no less than 10 years type of work have been examined.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">We have been successful in
    overcoming industrial hypokinesis employing the electrical stimulation of muscles
    transcutaneously by stimulating the muscle triceps and the muscle erector spinae using the
    modulated low frequency and voltage alternating electric current from device
    &quot;Myorhythm-021&quot;. The duration of exposure was 10 min. The course of treatment
    consisted of procedures in threshold regime. The stimulation by low voltage and frequency
    modulated alternating current device &quot;Myorhythm-021&quot; was being performed
    directly at the working place without interrupting even for a second the production
    process [ 3, 4] . The investigation has been carried out both in nonstimulated and
    stimulated groups before applying electromyostimulation, during EMS and after EMS.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">3. Results.</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Research has shown that
    the method suggested is an effective means improving the vegetative function of the
    skeletal muscles of the working women (n - of persons studied - 16; n - of examinations -
    108). It also arouses positive emotions and contributes strongly to lessening the feeling
    of fatigue, which appears during the working process. The data adduced indicate that
    electromyostimulation increases the arterial blood flow both in the stimulation (19.1±
    6.6% ) and post-stimulation (15.5± 10.9% ) periods, p&lt;0.05 as compared with the
    control period, i.e. the pre-stimulation period.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Electromyostimulation
    decreases the venous haemostasia in the foot (10.45± 4.37% ) and lower leg (3.42± 1.61%
    ) in the second part of the working shift. Meanwhile the results are reverse in the
    non-stimulated group. There is essential difference between the two groups (n - of persons
    studied - 16; n - of examinations - 108) compared, p&lt;0.05.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Electromyostimulation
    increase the rate of the nervous impulse (3.35± 0.81% ). There is essential difference
    between the groups (n - of persons studied - 16; n - of examinations - 32) compared,
    p&lt;0.05.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Electromyostimulation
    significantly improves bioelectric activity (mA) and mechanical work (kg s) ratio in the
    stimulated group (4.53% ).</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Griunbaum test (reflected
    fatigue of nervous system: duration of sensomotor reaction in s) </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The nonstimulated group (n
    - of persons studied - 121; n - of examinations - 4.840) showed an increase in the index
    of industrial fatigue at the end the working week (6.58% ).</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">In the process reverse was
    observed in the stimulated group (n - of persons studies - 35; n - of examination -
    1.400). The stimulated group showed decrease in the index of industrial fatigue at the end
    of working week ( 75.84% ). There is an essential difference between the groups,
    p&lt;0.05.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The analysis of the data
    obtained from questionnaires after examining 2.522 women workers at several factories of
    Lithuania engaged in the same sitting type of work at assembly-line as regards the
    subjective influence of EMS have shown positive influence in 89.17% of cases, no tangible
    influence in 8.64% of cases and negative effect (difficulties in mowing and pain in the
    stimulated area) in 2.18% of cases.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The indisputable merit of
    the method suggested lies in the fact that rehabilitation by means of EMS is performed
    immediately after the first manifestation of fatigue directly at the working place without
    interrupting the process of production. The latter circumstance is of great importance for
    both parties engaged in production process: the worker is tempted by the possibility of
    earning more without getting fatigued while the employer is satisfied with a greater
    amount of work well done.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">The determinant influence
    of electrostimulation on vegetative functions of the skeletal muscle during rehabilitation
    is obviously related with improvement of peripheral blood circulation as well increased
    activity of the sympathetic nervous system through augmented afferent performance.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">A great advantage of the
    method of electrostimulation applied to overcome the fatigue is the fact that all
    procedures are performed at the place of work without interrupting the process of
    production. It might be supposed, consequently, that lessening of industrial fatigue in
    the workers applying the stimulation of the skeletal muscles could be a new trend in
    treating occupational injuries.</font></p>
    <b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">4. Conclusions.</font></p>
    </b><p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">1. Research has shown
    that the method of electric stimulation is rapidly restoring vegetative performance of
    haemodynamic and motor functions of the skeletal muscles. It arouses positive emotions and
    contributes strongly to lessening the feeling of fatigue, which appears in the working
    process.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">2. The determinant
    influence of electrostimulation on vegetative functions of the skeletal muscle during
    rehabilitation is obviously related with improvement of peripheral blood circulation as
    well increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system through augmented afferent
    performance.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">3. The facts adduced above
    that the method of electrostimulation is a simple but efficient method reducing production
    fatigue without disrupting the process of production.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40; text-align: justify"><font size="2">Lessening of industrial
    fatigue in the workers applying the stimulation of the skeletal muscles could be a new
    trend in treating occupational injuries.</font></td>
